# Ticket Transcripts

This repository stores ticket transcripts generated by a Discord bot for the Crystal Rust Support system. The transcripts are saved as HTML files in the `transcripts/` directory and can be viewed on the GitHub Pages site: [https://tinialina.github.io/ticket-transcripts/](https://tinialina.github.io/ticket-transcripts/).

## Structure
- `index.html`: The main page listing all transcripts.
- `style.css`: CSS styles for the index page and transcripts.
- `transcripts/`: Directory containing the HTML transcript files.

## How It Works
1. The Discord bot generates a transcript when a ticket is closed using the `$delete` command.
2. The transcript is pushed to this repository in the `transcripts/` directory.
3. The `index.html` page lists all transcripts and provides links to view them.

## Viewing Transcripts
